## What is Storybook?

Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. It helps you develop and share hard-to-reach states and edge cases without needing to run your whole app. Thousands of teams use it for UI development, testing, and documentation. It's open source and free.

Storybook is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.
